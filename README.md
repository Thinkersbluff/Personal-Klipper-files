# This repository contains Thinkersbluff's Personal Klipper files

Rather than try to manage my own configuration files separately from those of @K2Van within the one forked version of his repository, I use this repo to document and preserve my own version of the Klipper configuration files, which I create and maintain for use on my CR6-SE and my Ender-3 printers. You are welcome to study/copy/reuse any of these files, if you wish, but please note that these files may contain errors, inefficiencies and poor programming practices. 

I make no warranty whatsoever that these files are suitable for use by others.  I do, however, like to learn and always appreciate constructive feedback. 
Please 
 - open an Issue here if you wish to flag problems or ask questions or 
 - fork the repository and submit a PR, to recommend enhancements.
